# Slimefun4 Addon
This is an addon for Slimefun4 which aims to add various money and economy based items for setting up your server.

## Notes,
This does NOT include any sort of shop mechanics, this only adds items for setting one up with your choice of shop plugin.

Navigate to `pom.xml` and change the group id to "me.%Your name%" and change the artifact id to the name of your Project.

After that you are good to go, you can now start developing your own Addon for Slimefun4.
